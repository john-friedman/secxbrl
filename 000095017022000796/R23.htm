Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. On January 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. Rather than respond to the defendants&#8217; motion, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On March 17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 13, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on the motion. On March 28, 2018, the Court denied defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss. Defendants filed a request for interlocutory appeal, and the Delaware Supreme Court denied that request without ruling on the merits but electing not to hear an appeal at this early stage of the case. Defendants filed their answer on May 18, 2018, and mediations were held on June 10, 2019. Plaintiffs and defendants filed respective motions for summary judgment on August 25, 2019, and further mediations were held on October 3, 2019. The Court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment on November 4, 2019. On January 22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount to be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020.

On February 4, 2020, the Court issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs&#8217; previously-filed motion for summary judgment and granted in part and denied in part defendants&#8217; previously-filed motion for summary judgment. The case was set for trial in March 2020 until it was postponed by the Court due to safety precautions concerning COVID-19. The trial was held from July 12 to July 23, 2021 and on August 16, 2021. </span><span style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,1);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;">On October 22, 2021, the Court approved the parties&#8217; joint stipulation that (a) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; and (b) the direct claims against Elon Musk are dismissed with prejudice.

The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018; and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims.

On September 30, 2021, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a verified amended derivative complaint. On October 1, 2021, defendants Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson moved for summary judgment as to the claims against them. Following the motion, plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson. Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment on October 1, 2021. On October 27, 2021, the Court approved the parties&#8217; joint stipulation that, among other things, (a) all claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson in the Complaint are dismissed with prejudice; (b) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; and (c) the direct claims against the remaining defendants are dismissed with prejudice. On November 18, 2021, the remaining defendants (a) moved for partial summary judgment, (b) opposed plaintiff&#8217;s summary judgment motion, and (c) opposed the plaintiff&#8217;s motion to amend his complaint. Oral argument on summary judgment and the motion to amend were set for January 6, 2022, however, it was canceled by the Court. The case was recently assigned to a different judge. Trial is currently set for April 18-22, 2022.</span></p><p style="text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:14.0pt;line-height:1.15;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:left;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:italic;">Litigation Related to Directors&#8217; Compensation</span></p><p style="text-indent:4.533%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:4.5pt;line-height:1.15;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:left;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;">On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla&#8217;s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla&#8217;s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief.

All of the suits are now pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they each purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to Mr. Musk&#8217;s statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla&#8217;s securities. Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as defendants the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors. The now-consolidated purported stockholder class action was stayed while the issue of selection of lead counsel was briefed and argued before the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit ruled regarding lead counsel. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on November 22, 2019. The hearing on the motion was held on March 6, 2020. On April 15, 2020, the Court denied defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. On January 11, 2022, plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary judgment which is currently pending before the Court.

In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based upon Mr. Musk&#8217;s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan&#8217;s adjustment as a violation of the parties&#8217; agreement. In 2021 Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements.</span><span style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;">  </span></p><p style="text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:14.0pt;line-height:1.15;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:left;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:italic;">Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Race Discrimination</span><span style="color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:italic;"> </span></p><p style="text-indent:4.533%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:9.0pt;line-height:1.15;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:left;"><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;">On October 4, 2021, in a case captioned </span><span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:italic;">Diaz v.

The Company does not believe that the facts and law justify the verdict. On November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a request for a new trial or reduction of the jury's damages.
